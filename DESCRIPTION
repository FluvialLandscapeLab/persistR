Title: Set and Retrieve Persistent Values Across R Sessions
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Geoffrey Poole
Maintainer: The package maintainer <gpoole@eco-metrics.com>
Description: In scripts, it is sometimes useful to be able to set values once 
    and then retrieve them in future R sessions.  For instance, one can avoid 
    putting login credentials in plain text in code.  persistR creates an 
    .RData file to store a named list.  You can add values to, retrieve value from, 
    and remove values from this saved list.  Once added, they will persist on disk 
    and you can retrieve them any time until you choose to remove the values.
